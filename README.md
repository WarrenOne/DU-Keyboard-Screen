# DU-Keyboard-Screen
This is a Lua RenderScript for screens and signs in Dual Universe that outputs the key that the mouse is hovering on. Feel free to use it as an on-screen keyboard for your own scripts

To see an example of the screen's output, copy the Board script to a programming board and link it to the screen with the Renderscript pasted into
